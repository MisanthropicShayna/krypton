# The Krypton Password Manager

Krypton is an open source command line password manager built in Python, intended for power users with a heavy emphasis on privacy. I created this password manager because I don't trust my credentials in the hands of company servers running proprietary code behind closed doors; I want complete control over my password manager, its security, and where the data ends up. I also find most password managers to be lacking in basic features as a result of oversimplifying user interaction for the sake of appealing to the average consumer - this is not one such password manager.



### You shouldn't use Krypton if...
- You're unfamiliar with the command line, or dislike using it.
- You can't live without a mobile app or browser extension (coming in the future).
- You favor mouse controls over keyboard controls.
- You have an aversion to learning curves.
- You value convenience over privacy.

### You should use Krypton if...
- You want direct control over how and where your encrypted credentials are stored.
- You don't want to sign up for anything, or give your data to anyone.
- You want more advanced functionality out of your password manager.
- You're more comfortable with a command line, or find it more efficient than a GUI.
- You have Python experience, and want a password manager that can be easily tweaked or extended.
